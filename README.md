# Operating System

This repository contains various codes and assignments related to Operating Systems. The implementations cover key OS concepts such as system calls, process management, synchronization methods, and more. It also includes practical examples to help understand OS functionalities in depth.

## 🛠️ Requirements 
To run and understand these OS operations, a Virtual Machine is required since some system calls and functionalities are not supported natively on Windows. The recommended setup is:
1. VirtualBox (or any other virtualization software)
2. A Linux-based OS (e.g., Ubuntu) as the virtual machine

## 🎯 Purpose 
The aim of this repository is to serve as a resource for students, educators, and enthusiasts interested in learning about Operating Systems. Each implementation is designed to demonstrate key OS concepts with structured code and explanatory comments. This repository is ideal for those studying OS fundamentals, preparing for technical interviews, or working on academic projects.
## 🚀 Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   
   git clone https://github.com/RaianRashidRimon/Operating-System.git
2. Since OS operations require a Virtual Machine or a Linux-based OS, ensure you have VirtualBox set up with a Linux distribution. Then, navigate to the folder inside your virtual machine and run the desired code using a terminal and a compatible compiler (e.g., GCC for C programs):
